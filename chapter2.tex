\chapter{Safety and Security Policies}\label{ch:policies}
Currently the hardware provides only a small number of security mechanisms \TODO{name some}, 
leaving most of the work to the software. This requires that the software 
performs various sanity-checks during an execution and that it carefully 
maintains various safety and security invariants, a tedious and error-prone task
that results in high runtime performance overheads.  

Many potentially effective mitigation techniques are not deployed because of the
performance overhead they incur. Another requirement for deployment of a 
protection mechanism is the compatibility with existing executables and 
the degree of intervention required by a human. 
Usually even making slight changes to a code and redistributing has high cost
and the protection mechanism is likely to see very low adoption. 

The lack of efficient and effective generic ways to enforce security policies, 
forces programmers to protect their own code, a task which is not trivial even 
for the small and simply programs. As a result most, if not all, software 
carries weaknesses which can be exploited by an attacker. ``Safe'' languages, 
automate some of the checks required and eases the work of the programmer,
for example by implementing array bounds checking or by disallowing 
pointer-arithmetic. However these solutions only reduce the chance of 
introducing exploitable bugs in a program and do not enforce stricter, 
more effective policies such as Control Flow Integrity
or complete Memory Safety (spatial/temporal protection for heap and stack). 
In addition, we still need effective and efficient protection mechanisms for a 
plethora of software written in unsafe languages such as C.

\section{A Programmable Unit for Metadata Processing}\label{sec:pump}

The Programmable Unit for Metadata Processing (PUMP) architecture
\cite{pump_hasp2014}
allows us to efficiently implement a wide range of security policies 
\cite{pump_ccs2014} by associating metadata to the data being processed 
(e.g., this is an instruction, this is from the network, this is private),
propagating the metadata as instructions are executed and using a rules-based 
system to check invariants on the metadata in parallel with the main computation.
Abstractly, the tag propagation rules form a partial function from a set of 
input tags to a set of output tags
$$(opcode, tag_{pc},tag_{instr}, tag_{arg1}, tag_{arg2}, tag_{arg3})
\nrightarrow (tag_{pc'},tag_{result})$$
informally read as, ``if the next instruction to be executed is opcode, the 
current tag of the program counter is $pc_{tag}$, the current tag on the 
instruction location is $tag_{instr}$ and the tags on the operands of the 
instruction are $tag_{arg1}, tag_{arg2}$ and $tag_{arg3}$ then if execution of 
the instruction is allowed the tag on the program counter should be set
to $tag_{pc'}$ and any new data created by the instruction should be tagged 
$tag_{result}$''.

On the hardware level, the PUMP is an extension to a conventional RISC 
architecture. Every word of data in the machine - whether in memory 
or a register, is extended with a word-sized metadata tag.
These tags are not interpreted by hardware, instead the interpretation of the 
tags is left to the software, thus making it easy to implement new policies on 
the metadata. Since tags are word-sized, they can be pointers to complex 
data-structures of tags, such as tuples of tags, allowing for complex policies 
to be expressed and multiple orthogonal policies to be enforced in parallel.

The hardware undertakes the correct propagation of tags from operands to results 
according to the rules defined by the software. 
A hardware rule cache mapping sets of input tags to sets of output tags is used 
for common case efficiency. On each instruction dispatch, in parallel 
with the usual behavior of an instruction 
(\EG execution of an addition in the ALU), the hardware forms the set of input 
tags and a lookup is performed on the rule cache. If the lookup is successful
a set of output tags is returned and combined with the results of the normal 
execution of the  instruction a new state is produced. On the other hand, 
if the lookup failed, the hardware invokes a trusted piece of system software - 
the fault handler - which checks the input tags and decides whether the 
execution should be allowed or not. In the first case, the fault handler returns
a set of result tags, a pair of set of input and output tags is formed and
inserted into the rules cache, while the faulting instruction is restarted 
and will now hit the cache. Otherwise, execution of this instruction violated 
some rules of the enforced policy and execution should not continue normally 
(\EG should be halted).

As described in the original PUMP paper by Dehon \ETAL \cite{pump_hasp2014} and 
in more detail in the follow-up \cite{pump_ccs2014} a rich set of effective 
security policies can be efficiently implemented using the architecture 
mentioned above. In particular, implementations of dynamic typing, memory safety
for heap-based data, control flow integrity and taint tracking are described, 
evaluated against a specific threat model and benchmarked. The benchmarks are
done using a simulation of the described hardware and the two papers claim low
overhead (~10\% on average) for each of the policies named above.

Compared to other software solutions for enforcing security policies, the PUMP 
offers  significantly lower overhead, thanks to dedicated hardware assistance, 
while the fact that interpretation of the metadata is done by software offers 
flexibility with regard to the policies that can be implemented, compared to 
hardware solutions implementing a specific policy.

While the PUMP offers flexibility at a low runtime performance overhead, 
there are more overheads associated to such a mechanism. For example adding 
metadata to all the data in the machine, would result in a 100\% memory overhead.
In addition, the extra hardware and the rule cache along with potentially larger
memories could result into a 400\% overhead on energy usage. \cite{pump_ccs2014}
The authors claim that a careful and well-optimized implementation can reduce 
these numbers, resulting in a 50\% energy overhead.

\section{Micro-policies: A Framework for Verified, Hardware-Assisted Security 
Monitors}\label{sec:micropolicies}

The software components that can be changed to enforce a security policy
are collectively called a micro-policy.
Unsurprisingly, designing a security policy, reasoning about it's effectiveness 
against potential attackers and encoding it as a micro-policy can become a 
complex task. Azevedo \ETAL \cite{pump_popl2015} built a generic framework for
defining micro-policies on top of a simple machine modeling a RISC processor 
augmented with the PUMP hardware (referred to as concrete machine), formalized
this framework in Coq and used it to define and formally verify micro-policies
for dynamic sealing, control-flow integrity, memory safety, compartmentalization
and protecting the monitor code itself.
\FEEDBACK{maybe I should mention the word monitor at some point earlier}

The framework offers a high-level machine, called the symbolic machine, that
abstracts away from unnecessary implementation details and can be used as an 
interface to the concrete machine, simplifying the work of the micro-policy 
designer. Additionally the symbolic machine is used to simplify correctness 
proofs. To instantiate the symbolic machine, the micro-policy designer needs to
provide a set of symbolic tags which will be used to tag the various values of
the machine, a transfer function that monitors program execution and determines
how tags are propagated in each step and optionally a set of monitor services 
that are partial functions from machine states to machine states and can be used
to control the monitor's behavior dynamically.

In order to implement the micro-policy at the concrete machine level, one needs
to additionally provide machine code that implements the transfer function, an
encoding of tags to words and machine code for any monitor services that the
micro-policy may use. The relation between the symbolic and the concrete machine
is formally defined as a two-way refinement (forward and backward). This is a 
generic refinement proof, parameterized by the encoding of the symbolic tags to
words and a proof of correctness of the monitor code for a micro-policy.
The designer of a micro-policy can use this two-way refinement simply by
providing these two parameters.

\subsection{Correctness of micro-policies}\label{sec:verification}

For each micro-policy an abstract machine which serves as a specification to the
invariants the policy designer wants to enforce is defined. The abstract machine 
is ``correct'' by construction, meaning that it's designed to respect those 
invariants. Using the symbolic machine as an intermediate step to simplify the
proofs, by proving a refinement between the symbolic and the abstract machine 
and by utilizing the the generic refinement between the symbolic and the
concrete machine, we can prove a refinement between the abstract and
the concrete machine, thus showing that every valid step for the concrete
machine is also a valid step for the abstract machine. 
\FEEDBACK{say smth about steps and refinement earlier..}

\subsection{Basic Machine}\label{sec:basic}

All the machines introduced in the original paper by Azevedo \ETAL 
\cite{pump_popl2015}, 
as well as this thesis, have a similar structure. In particular, they share a
common RISC-based instruction set (with a few - uninteresting for the scope of
this thesis - exceptions) and they have a fixed number of general-purpose
registers, along with a pc register. Of course the abstract machine defined
by the policy designer can differ in various ways, but more similarities with
the symbolic machine implies easier proofs of correctness.

\TODO{write down a few rules?}

\subsection{Symbolic Machine}\label{sec:symbolic}

As mentioned above, the symbolic machine enables us to abstract away from 
various low-level details of the concrete machine. We can express and reason
about policies in terms of mathematical objects written in Gallina rather than
machine code and the corresponding proofs for the concrete machine comes for 
free under some assumptions.The symbolic machine follows the structure of the 
basic machine but it's augmented to better match a PUMP architecture. 
Specifically the symbolic machine is parameterized by the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A set of symbolic tags, used to tag the contents of the memory, the
registers and the pc.
\item A partial function \TRANSFER, that on every step checks whether the
step is allowed according to opcode of the instruction executed and the tags on
it. In the case it's allowed it returns a tag for the new pc and for any 
resulting data from executing the instruction.
\item A partial function \textit{get\_service}, mapping addresses to 
\textit{symbolic monitor services}. In the symbolic machine, monitor services
are represented as a tuple of a partial function on machine states and a
symbolic tag.
\item An internal machine state with an initial value, that can be used by 
monitor services.
\end{itemize}

The states of the symbolic machine consists of a memory, registers, a \pc 
register and an internal state.
The memory  and register contents, as well as the \pc, are all tagged with a
symbolic tag \textit{t}. We name their contents \textit{symbolic atoms} referred
to with the notation \atom{\ii{w}}{\ii{t}}, where \ii{w} is the value (word) and
\ii{t} is the tag.

At each step, a record named \emph{mvector} is formed. It consists of the 
current opcode, the tag on the \pc, the tag on the current instruction and 
optionally up to three tags depending on the opcode of the instruction.
The \emph{mvector} is passed to the transfer function
which decides whether the step violated the policy enforced by the \TRANSFER
function and in this case halts the machine, or if no violation occurred returns
a tag for the new \pc and a tag for any results the instruction execution 
produced.

We write, in form of inference rules, the stepping relation for the Store and 
Jump instructions, in order to demonstrate the above mechanism. The complete
definition of the stepping relation can be found at \TODO{cite appendix}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule[Store]{
  \mem[\pc] = \atom{i}{\ti} \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Store}~r_p~r_s  \\
  \rd{\reg}{r_p} {=} \atom{w_p}{t_p} \andalso
  \rd{\reg}{r_s} {=} \atom{w_s}{t_s} \andalso
  \rd{\mem}{w_p} {=} \atom{w\old}{t\old} \\
  \handler{\ii{Store}}{\tpc}{\ti}{t_p}{t_s}{t\old} {\tpc'}{t_d'} \\
  \mem' = \upd{\mem}{w_p}{w_s@t_d'}
  }{\step{\astat{\mem}{\reg}{\atom{\pc}{\tpc}}{int}}
  {\astat{\mem'}{\reg}{\atom{\pc + 1}{\tpc'}}{int}}
  }
\bigskip

\infrule[Jump]{
  \mem[\pc] = \atom{i}{\ti} \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Jump}~r \andalso
  \rd{\reg}{r} {=} \atom{w}{t_w} \\
  \handler{\ii{Jump}}{\tpc}{\ti}{t_w}{-}{-} {\tpc'}{-}
  }{\step{\astat{\mem}{\reg}{\atom{\pc}{\tpc}}{int}}
  {\astat{\mem}{\reg}{\atom{w}{\tpc'}}{int}}
  }
\caption{Symbolic stepping relation for Store and Jump}
\end{figure}

Notice that when a store instruction executed, the tag on the memory location to
be overwritten is fetched, allowing the \TRANSFER function to know what kind of
data we are trying to overwrite.

\subsection{Concrete Machine}\label{sec:concrete}

The concrete machine is a model of the basic machine with PUMP hardware, 
in particular a rules \cache and a software \emph{miss handler}. 
The instruction set has been extended with four additional instructions that 
are meant to be used by monitor code only, a restriction enforced by the monitor
self-protection mechanism.

The states of the concrete machine consists of a memory, registers, a \pc 
register, an \epc register a special purpose register that holds the address of
the faulting instruction after a cache miss and a cache.
The cache works as a key-value store where a key is an \emph{input vector} that
contains an instruction opcode, the concrete tag of the current instruction,
the concrete tag of the pc and up to three operand tags, and a value is an 
\emph{output vector} which contain a tag for the new pc and a tag for any
results from the execution of the instruction. Intuitively a concrete tag is the
encoding into a word of a symbolic tag. 
Lifting this encoding relation to vectors, we get that a concrete vector is the
encoding of a symbolic vector (\emph{mvector}). 
In accordance \FEEDBACK{em this sucks? does this word even exist? think about smth else?} to the symbolic machine
the contents of the memory, the registers, the pc and the epc are concrete atoms
\atom{w}{t} where w is a word and t is the encoding of a tag into a word.

The stepping relation for the concrete machine is a bit more complicated than
the one for the symbolic machine. In particular, on each step the machine forms
the \emph{input vector} and looks it up in the cache. If the lookup succeeds 
then the instruction is allowed, a \emph{output vector} is returned by the
cache and the next state is tagged according to it. 
If the lookup fails, then the \emph{input vector} is saved in memory, the 
current \pc is stored in \epc and the machine traps to the \emph{miss handler}.
The above are demonstrated in the two example rules below:

\TODO{put example rules}

Addresses 0 to 5 are used to store the \emph{input vector} and 6 to 7 are used
by the miss handler to store the \emph{output vector}. As a side-note, cache 
eviction is not modeled (an infinite cache is assumed).

\subsection{Concrete Policy Monitor}\label{sec:concrete_policy}

Unlike the symbolic machine, where the user cannot cannot change the 
\TRANSFER function, enforcing a micro-policy on the concrete machine requires
that we are able to protect the memory of the policy monitor and that privileged
instructions are not executed by user code. This self-protection policy can be 
easily composed with another micro-policy and enforced by the infrastructure
described above. 

Using tags of the form, \USER{\ii{st}}, \ENTRY{\ii{st}}, \MONITOR we can 
distinguish between user memory, monitor memory and monitor services. 
In particular \USER{\ii{st}} is used to tag a user-level atom, where \ii{st} is
the word-encoding of a symbolic tag. \MONITOR is used to tag the monitor memory
and a few reserved registers. The \pc is tagged with \MONITOR when a monitor
execution takes place and \USER{\ii{st}} when user-code is executed. The tag
\ENTRY{\ii{st}} is used to tag the first instruction of a monitor service and 
serves as an indication that execution will continue under the privileged
\MONITOR mode. 

The miss handler is a composed policy monitor that protects itself from
\USERname code and that enforces a desired micro-policy.
One important thing to note is that the miss handler for the concrete machine
can take an arbitrary number of steps before deciding that no violation occurred
and returning to \USERname  mode, unlike the symbolic \TRANSFER function that
does not need to take any steps.
