\chapter{Formally Verified Control-Flow Integrity Micro-Policy}\label{ch:verified_cfi}

Using the micro-policies framework described in \ref{sec:micropolicies} we 
proved that the concrete machine instantiated with a \CFI micro-policy like the
one described in \ref{sec:cfi_fine} \ii{simulates} an abstract machine that has
\CFI by construction.

Additionaly, we provide an attacker model for all the machines used and we prove
that a property capturing the notion of \CFI holds even when the attacker
tampers with the machine, similarly to what is proposed in \cite{abadi2005}, but
adapted to the setting of our machines.

\section{Representing control-flow graphs}\label{sec:cfi_tags}

Our approach for enforcing \CFI, as explained in \ref{sec:cfi_fine}, requires
that we encode the nodes in the control-flow graph in terms of identifiers,
which in turn are used to tag all sources and targets of indirect control-flows.

At this point we take a detour, to point out an important design point of 
the micro-policies framework and our \CFI micro-policy.
Throughout both developments, a heavily parametric and modular approach was 
taken. This parametric design is enabled by the use of the \emph{Section} and
\emph{Type Classes} mechanisms of Coq. As an example, the node identifiers,
along with a number of properties we require of them are expressed by the
following interface (defined in terms of a type class):

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

\coqdocnoindent
\}.\coqdoceol
\end{coqdoccode}
\caption{Interface of node identifiers}
\label{fig:id_class}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Context} command on the top of the code above, allows us to
\textit{assume} that there exists an instance of this interface.
In fact, the \emph{machine\_types} argument is just another type class,
serving as a specification of the various types of the machine (\EG the word 
size). This approach allowed us to abstract away from insignificant details and
structure our proofs in a clean way.
In addition, we can easily instantiate a different machine with minimal changes
in our proofs and definitions (\EG instantiate the machine with a different word
size).

However, one drawback is that one wrong specification in a type class would
disallow us to instantiate it and would require that we go back and change
all parts that used this wrong specification (\EG in our case, the 
\emph{machine\_types} class was widely used). Therefore one should be careful
when doing heavy use of such mechanisms.

Returning to the identifiers, looking at the definition in \ref{fig:id_class},
we require that the type of the identifiers \id is an Eqtype (has decidable
boolean equality) and that there exists conversion functions between elements
of type \word and \id, satisfying some constraints. 

\QUESTION{Should I give some intuition, as to why word\_to\_id is partial? Is it
obvious?}

\ch{moved here}
As mentioned in \ref{sec:cfi_fine}, we check for violations of the control-flow
with respect to a binary relation (on the identifiers) \CFG which represents
the set of allowed (indirect) jumps. We can extend this relation to precisely
describe the control-flow of a program, by lifting \CFG to a relation 
\SUCC on machine states, that includes the set of allowed targets for the rest
of the instructions. 

\ch{TODO: give code for CFG, very simple}

\section{Control-Flow Integrity Property}\label{sec:cfi_property}

Our formalization includes a definition of \CFI, similar to the one found in
\cite{abadi2005}, which we prove to be true of all our machines. The need for a
new definition arises from fundamental differences between our enforcement
mechanism on the concrete mechanism and the one used by Abadi \ETAL. In
particular, our enforcement-mechanism does not prevent a violation, instead
it can detect it after it has occurred by taking an arbitrary number of
``protected'' (monitor mode) steps before eventually bringing the machine to a
halt. This does not have any impact on the security effectiveness of our
mechanism, it does however lead to a more complex definition and therefore
more complex proofs.

The definition of \CFI is further parameterized by an attacker model. We
model the attacker as a step relation (\stepa{}{}). Intuitively the attacker is
allowed to change any \emph{user-level} data but not the code of the program and
the \pc, as well as the tags in the case of a tagged machine. 
This limitations ensures that an attacker cannot directly circumvent the monitor
protection mechanism and our user-level policies (\NWC , \NXD and \CFI). To 
account for attacker steps, the stepping relation is extended as the union of 
the normal step relation (\stepn{}{}), as defined by the machine semantics, and
the attacker step relation (\stepa{}{}), as defined by the attacker model.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\centering
\infrule[]{\stepa{s}{s'}
  }{\step{s}{s'}}
\label{fig:step_stepa}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Step relation definition}
\end{figure}

We define a predicate \INITIAL{s}, where s is a machine state, that
states that s is an initial state. We use this predicate to express some
invariants that are preserved through execution (\EG the initial tagging scheme
for the memory). Finally we define a stopping predicate on an execution trace
that states that the machine is coming to a halt with respect to normal steps.

Since we want to instantiate the above parameters in a different way for
each of our machines, it makes sense to wrap them in a type class which
we will instantiate for each machine to get the corresponding definition
of \CFI.

\end{figure}

\QUESTION{Unsure about the caption on the above figure}

For a machine of type cfi\_machine we give the following definitions:

\begin{definition}\label{definition:traceHasCfi}
  We say that an execution trace $s_0 \to s_1 \to \ldots \to s_n$ {\em has CFI}
  if for all $ i \in [0,\ldots,n)$ if \stepn{s_i}{s_{i+1}} then
  $(s_i,s_{i+1}) \in$ \SUCC .
\end{definition}

\QUESTION{The word relation for succ and cfg is strange since they are
booleans, is it ok, or does it confuse you, making you believe they are Props?}

The above definition corresponds to the one found in \cite{abadi2005}, however
it is stronger in the sense that it requires that steps that are in the
intersection of normal and attacker steps respect the control-flow. If we did
not allow for any violations then the above definition would be enough, but
since our enforcement mechanism allows for one violation we have to resort to a
weaker definition.

\begin{definition}[CFI]\label{definition:CFI}
  We say that the machine
  $(\ii{State}, \ii{initial}, \to_n,\allowbreak \to_a, \ii{cfg}, \ii{stopping})$
  has \CFI with respect to the set of allowed indirect jumps \CFG
  if, for any execution starting from initial state $s_0$
  and producing a trace $s_0 \to \ldots \to s_n$, either
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The whole trace has \CFI according to
    \autoref{definition:traceHasCfi}, or else
  \item There is some $i$ such that $s_i \to_n s_{i+1}$,
  and $(s_i, s_{i+1}) \not \in$ \SUCC, where
  the sub-traces $s_0 \to \ldots \to s_i$ and
  $s_{i+1} \to \ldots \to s_n$ both have CFI
  and the sub-trace $s_{i+1} \to \ldots \to s_n$ is stopping.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{The Abstract Machine}\label{sec:abstract_cfi}

The abstract machine
has \CFI, \NXD and \NWC by construction and will serve as a 
specification for the symbolic and eventually the concrete machine that
implement \CFI through the tag-based system explained in the previous chapter.

Unlike the symbolic and the concrete machine, this abstract machine splits the 
memory into two disjoint memories, an instruction memory and a data memory. The
instruction memory is fixed (non-writable) and the machine uses this memory to
fetch instructions to execute, so \NWC and \NXD are enforced by construction.

In addition the state of the machine includes an \ok bit, indicating 
whether a control-flow violation has occurred or not. The rest of the machine
state is completed by a set of registers and a \pc register. We use a 5-tuple
notation for the state \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok}, where the first
field is the instruction memory, the second the data memory, the third the
registers, the fourth is the pc register and the fifth is the \ok bit.

\subsection{Operational semantics}\label{abstract_semantics}
Below is the step rule for the Store instruction, illustrating both \NWC and 
\NXD. Notice that the instruction is fetched by the instruction memory and
the store is done on the data memory.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule[Store]{
  \imem[\pc] = i \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Store}~r_p~r_s \andalso
  \rd{\reg}{r_p} = p \\
  \rd{\reg}{r_s} = w \andalso
  \dmem' = \upd{\dmem}{p}{w}
  }{\step{\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ii{true}}}{
    \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc+1}{\ii{true}}}}
\caption{Step rule for Store instruction of abstract machine}
\end{figure}

In the above rule, the \ok bit is true for both the starting and the
resulting state. In fact, the machine can take a step only when the \ok
bit is set to true. In the above rule, the \ok bit is set to true in the
resulting state, indicating that no control-flow violation has happened, as
expected by the execution of a Store instruction. Control-flow violations in the
\NWC setting our machine is executing, can only occur from \emph{indirect} jump
instructions, in our case the Jump and Jal instructions. Upon execution of a
Jump or Jal instruction, a function \J, which represents the set of allowed
jumps, checks whether the change of control-flow is legal. If the jump is not 
allowed according to \J then the jump is taken but the \ok bit is set to false, 
which will halt the machine in the next step as it is only allowed to step when
the \ok bit is set to true.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule[Jal]{
  \imem[\pc] = i \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Jal}~r \andalso
  \rd{\reg}{r} = \pc' \\
  \reg' = \upd{\reg}{\ra}{pc+1} \andalso
  \ii{ok} = (\pc,\pc') \in \Jm
  }{\step{\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ii{true}}}{
    \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ii{ok}}}}
\bigskip

\infrule[Jump]{
  \imem[\pc] = i \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Jump}~r \andalso
  \rd{\reg}{r} = \pc' \andalso
  \ii{ok} = (\pc,\pc') \in \Jm
  }{\step{\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ii{true}}}{
    \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ii{ok}}}}
\caption{Step rule for Jump and Jal instruction of abstract machine}
\end{figure}

As the abstract machine serves as a specification to a machine with \CFI, a more
intuitive definition of it would not include the \ok bit and would only allow
the Jump and Jal instructions to step if they do not violate the control-flow
graph. However, this abstract machine would not allow for any violations to
occur unlike our enforcement mechanism for the symbolic and the concrete machine
and would lead to more complex simulation proofs, therefore we do not favor it.

The abstract machine also allows for monitor services to be included, although
the \CFI enforcement mechanism does not require any. We assume that a monitor
service is a privileged action and that it's execution does not violate the
control-flow of the program. Execution of a monitor service is done simply by
jumping to it's address, there is no separate instruction. Th
As with all other instructions, execution of the monitor service is only allowed
if the \ok bit is set to true.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule[Service]{

    \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ii{true}}
  }{\stepn{\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ii{true}}}{
    \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ii{true}}}}
\caption{Step rule for monitor services of abstract machine}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proving \CFI for the abstract machine}\label{abstract_proof}

\subsubsection{Attacker model}\label{sec:abstract_attacker}

The attacker for the abstract machine is allowed to change the
contents of the data memory and the registers but not the rest of the state.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule{
  \ii{dom}~\dmem = \ii{dom}~\dmem' \andalso
  \ii{dom}~\reg = \ii{dom}~\reg'
}{
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} \to_a^A
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc}{\ok}
}
\caption{Attacker model for the abstract machine}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Allowed control-flows for the abstract machine}
\label{sec:abstract_flow}

Assuming a function \CFG that represents the set of allowed (indirect) jumps,
we can construct a function \SUCC for the abstract machine that represents
the set of allowed control-flows for all instructions.\ch{Make it clearer
  that this \SUCC is for the abstract machine}

Below we give a specification of the \SUCC function for the abstract machine,
in form of inference rules. A function is defined in the actual Coq development.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule[IndirectFlows]{
  \imem[\pc] = i 
  \andalso \ii{decode}~i \in \lbrace \ii{Jal~r}, \ii{Jump~r} \rbrace
  \andalso (\pc,\pc') \in \CFGm
  }{
  (\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} ,
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ok}) \in \SUCCm}
\bigskip

\infrule[ConditionalFlows]{
  \imem[\pc] = i 
  \andalso \ii{decode}~i = \ii{Bnz~r~imm}\\
   (\pc' = \pc + 1) \vee (\pc' = \pc + imm)
  }{
  (\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} ,
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ok}) \in \SUCCm}
\bigskip

\infrule[NormalFlows]{
  \imem[\pc] = i 
  \andalso 
  \ii{decode}~i \not\in \lbrace \ii{Jal~r}, \ii{Jump~r}, \ii{Bnz~r~imm}, 
  \varnothing \rbrace
  \\ \pc' = \pc + 1
  }{
  (\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} ,
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ok}) \in \SUCCm}
\bigskip

\infrule[ServiceFlows]{
  \imem[\pc] = \varnothing \andalso \dmem[\pc] = \varnothing\\
  \ii{get\_service}~\pc = (addr,f)
  }{
  (\acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} ,
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc'}{\ok}) \in \SUCCm}
\caption{Legal control-flows for instructions of the abstract machine}
\end{figure}

Notice that a monitor service is allowed to return anywhere. As we mentioned
before, monitor services, execute in a protected environment and we assume them
to be secure.

\subsubsection{Stopping predicate for the abstract machine}
\label{sec:abstract_stopping}

Finally, we define what it means for the abstract machine to be ``stopping'' by
defining a predicate on execution traces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All states in the trace are stuck with respect to normal steps (\stepn{}{})
\item All steps in the trace are attacker steps (\stepa{}{})
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Abstract machine as a \CFI machine}\label{abstract_cfi}

Regarding initial states, we only require that the \ok bit is set to true.
We can now instantiate the class of the machines defined in 
\ref{fig:cfi_machine}, with the abstract machine and then prove the following
theorem.

\begin{thm}[Abstract CFI]\label{thm:CFIabstract}
The abstract machine has the \CFI property defined by \ref{definition:CFI}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The proof procceeds by induction on the execution trace.
\end{proof}
\QUESTION{Should I write some proofs informally?}


\section{The Symbolic  Machine}\label{sec:symbolic_cfi}

The symbolic machine was described in \ref{sec:symbolic}. Unlike the abstract
machine, the symbolic machine has one memory and distinction between data
and executable instructions is made through tags, in a similar fashion to what
was shown in \ref{nwc_nxd} and \ref{cfi_fine}. We instantiate the symbolic
machine, according to the aforementioned sections, with a set of tags
\TAGS{\DATA,\INSTR{\ii{id}}, \INSTR{\bot}},\ch{Bring in Inductive}
where id now is drawn from the class
of identifiers \ref{fig:cfi_id}. We do not have any monitor services and
we do not need any internal state for this micro-policy therefore, only the
transfer function is left to implement.

\subsection{Transfer Function}\label{sec:transfer_fun}

We implement the \TRANSFER function based on the rules found in
\ref{sec:cfi_fine}, using Gallina to define a function mapping
input vectors (mvector) to output vectors (rvector).

\end{figure}


Although, the rules in \ref{sec:cfi_fine} were fairly simply, expressing them
using Gallina's pattern matching increased their size. We also experimented,
with different ways of writing the transfer function but we decided to stick
with the definition above as it's the most straightforward. It's worth to note
that bugs in the above definition were easily made apparent when proving
theorems involving the transfer function. In fact, an ``interesting'' experiment
was to re-define the above function in a different way and prove the two 
equivalent. It took two iterations before getting both functions to agree
and although for small definitions like the one above, testing or manually
reviewing the code will reveal most if not all bugs, the importance of formal
verification in software engineering and critical software is made obvious
even for definitions that may seem trivial at first. The correctness of the
transfer function will come from simulation proofs between the abstract
and the symbolic machine.

\subsection{Attacker model}\label{sec:symbolic_attacker}

Similar to the abstract attacker, the symbolic attacker can change all words
tagged as \DATAname but not the ones tagged as \INSTRname. This is expressed by
the following relations:


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.25\linewidth}
\centering
\infrule[AttackData]{\atom{w_1}{\DATA}
  }{\atom{w_2}{\DATA}}
\label{fig:Attack_{data}}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.15\linewidth}
\centering
\infrule[AttackInstr]{\atom{w_1}{\INSTR{id}}
  }{\atom{w_1}{\INSTR{id}}}
\label{fig:Attack_{instr}}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Attacker capabilities}
\end{figure}

These attacker relations on symbolic atoms are extended to a relation on the
memory and the registers.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\infrule{
  \ii{dom}~\dmem = \ii{dom}~\dmem' \andalso
  \ii{dom}~\reg = \ii{dom}~\reg'
}{
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem}{\reg}{\pc}{\ok} \to_a^A
  \acfistat{\imem}{\dmem'}{\reg'}{\pc}{\ok}
}
