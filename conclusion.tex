\section{Future Work}

There are many directions still left to explore before we can consider
our work done. Some of them include writing the \CFI monitor code and
verifying it, increasing precision by enforcing call-stack protection,
scaling to more complex architectures, looking for ways to enforce
\CFI like properties on self modifying programs and more.
