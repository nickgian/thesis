\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

Computer hardware and software continuously grow in size and complexity and as a
result ensuring the absence of exploitable behaviors is becoming increasingly 
difficult. In the era when \FEEDBACK{where?}computer systems are used extensively to
carry important information (e.g. credit card numbers, national security
documents), it has been widely accepted that security of these systems is a
priority. Researchers have identified a number of potential vulnerabilities
which arise from the violation of known but in-practice unenforceable safety
and security policies.
 
So far, computer security has been delegated mostly to software, while
the hardware is being almost completely controlled by the software.
High-level languages are becoming more widely used, due to features
such as strong type systems with type inference and automatic memory
management, making programming less error prone and reducing the
number of exploitable bugs. Furthermore, in order to strengthen the
security of computing systems a variety of low-level mitigation
techniques \cite{Cowan:1998:SAA:1267549.1267554,PaX,
  Erlingsson:2007:LSS:1793914.1793919}

have been proposed, however these are mostly ad-hoc solutions designed
to prevent specific known attacks, rather than enforcing a security
policy by preventing a well-defined class of attacks, thus making it
hard to reason about their effectiveness. In fact most of these
mitigation techniques can be circumvented by attackers
\cite{Szekeres2013}, which has lead to a continuous ``chase'' between
attackers and security researchers.

One common attack technique is to exploit some low-level vulnerability
such as a buffer overflow to redirect the control flow to attacker
injected code. This attack can be stopped by a simple protection
scheme known as $W \oplus X$, which enforces that a memory page is
either executable or writable but not both.  Unfortunately, clever
attack techniques can bypass $W \oplus X$. In particular, attackers
have been using code-reuse attacks (e.g. return/jump - oriented
programming) that allows them to chain together existing pieces of
code to achieve malicious behavior without directly introducing new
code.  Abadi~\ETAL\cite{abadi2005} introduced a property called
Control Flow Integrity (CFI), which provides effective protection
against control-flow hijacking attacks.  CFI enforces that any
execution of a program will respect a statically computed control flow
graph (CFG).  \FEEDBACK{missing references throughout}

The main contribution of this thesis is the formalization and
verification of a dynamic monitor for CFI, based on a generic
hardware-software security mechanism.
%
We provide a precise attacker model and prove in Coq that the monitor
enforces a variant of the CFI property proposed by
Abadi~\ETAL\cite{AbadiBEL09}.
%
To obtain this result we prove refinement between a concrete
machine running a monitor satisfying our Coq specification
and an abstract machine having CFI by construction.
%
We conclude the proof using a novel generic result stating that under
certain assumptions CFI is preserved by refinement.
\FEEDBACK{Is there anything missing here?}

\Cref{ch:policies} of this thesis briefly describes the motivation for
effective and efficient security policies, the desired properties a
robust security policy must satisfy and puts into context the
framework we utilize in order to formalize and enforce a Control-Flow
Integrity (CFI) policy.  

\Cref{ch:cfi} discusses the current state of
research on enforcing and formalizing Control-Flow Integrity and clarifies
the design choices of our approach regarding enforcement of \CFI.

\Cref{ch:verified_cfi} explains how we used the framework of \cref{ch:policies}
in order to formally reason about the security properties of the \CFI policy and
our approach to enforcing it.
