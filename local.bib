Uses decompilation and translation validation
Almost _fully automated_ using SMT solver!
We use a verified rule table compiler, but another way to go
  would have been to use a decompiler and translation validation;
  there is a very cool recent paper about using decompilation and
  translation validation for verifying the seL4 binary as produced
  by GCC -O1 and even -O2~\cite{SewellMK13}

This article presents the formal verification, using the Coq proof
assistant, of a memory model for low-level imperative languages such
as C and compiler intermediate languages.  Beyond giving semantics
to pointer-based programs, this model supports reasoning over
transformations of such programs.  We show how the properties of the
memory model are used to prove semantic preservation for three passes
of the Compcert verified compiler.},

  abstract = {A memory model is an important component of the formal
                  semantics of imperative programming languages: it
                  specifies the behavior of operations over memory
                  states, such as reads and writes. The formally
                  verified CompCert C compiler uses a sophisticated
                  memory model that is shared between the semantics of
                  its source language (the CompCert subset of C) and
                  intermediate languages. The algebraic properties of
                  this memory model play an important role in the
                  proofs of semantic preservation for the
                  compiler. The initial design of the CompCert memory
                  model is described in an article by Leroy and Blazy
                  (J. Autom. Reasoning 2008). The present research
                  report describes version 2 of this memory model,
                  improving over the main limitations of version
                  1. The first improvement is to expose the
                  byte-level, in-memory representation of integers and
                  floats, while preserving desirable opaqueness
                  properties of pointer values. The second improvement
                  is the integration of a fine-grained mechanism of
                  permissions (access rights), which supports more
                  aggressive optimizations over read-only data, and
                  paves the way towards shared-memory, data-race-free
                  concurrency in the style of Appel's Verified
                  Software Toolchain project.}
